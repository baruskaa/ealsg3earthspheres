                        One of the main components of Earth’s interdependent physical systems is the atmosphere. Earth’s atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and one percent other gasses. These gasses are found in atmospheric layers  defined by unique features such as temperature and pressure. <br> <br> The atmosphere protects life on earth by shielding it from incoming ultraviolet (UV) radiation, keeping the planet warm through insulation, and preventing extremes between day and night temperatures.

It extends from about 90 km (56 miles) to between 500 and 1,000 km (311 to 621 miles) above Earth's surface. Solar activity strongly influences temperature in the thermosphere. Temperatures in the upper thermosphere can range from about 500° C (932° F) to 2,000° C (3,632° F) or higher. Although the thermosphere is considered part of Earth's atmosphere, the air density is so low in this layer that most of the thermosphere is what we normally think of as outer space. The space shuttle and the International Space Station both orbit Earth within the thermosphere. It is also where aurora (Southern and Northern Lights) occur.

The coldest temperatures in Earth's atmosphere, about -90° C (-130° F), are found near the top of this layer. Most meteors vaporize in the mesosphere. Some material from meteors lingers in the mesosphere, causing this layer to have a relatively high concentration of iron and other metal atoms.
