                                <p>A plain is a landmass that is flat or gently rolling and covers many miles.  There are also different types of plains such as prairies, grasslands and steppes. There are a few ways that plains are formed. The first plains were created from lava flowing on Earth. Lava can burn things and make things that were almost flat, flatter. Erosion and deposits can also create plains.</p>

                                <p>They usually have steep sloping sides and sharp or rounded ridges and a high point called a peak or summit. Most geologists classify a mountain as a landform that rises at least 1,000 feet (300 meters) or more above its surrounding area. A mountain range is a series or chain of mountains that are close together.</p>

The different types include V-shaped (river), U-shaped (glacier), rift, and flat-floored valleys. Also Most of the valleys are formed by rivers that erode, or wear down, soil and rocks. Example is the Giant valleys, called rifts, that when two pieces of Earth's crust are separated or split apart.</p>
