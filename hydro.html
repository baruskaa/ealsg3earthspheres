                        <p>Water is continually moving through the atmosphere. Warm updrafts carry water into the atmosphere when it evaporates from the Earth's surface. It condenses into clouds, is driven by the wind, and eventually falls back to Earth as rain or snow. This cycle is a crucial mechanism for transferring heat and energy from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and transporting it from one location to another on our planet.

The ocean, although being salty, is also classified as surface water.<br> On the other hand, the frozen surface water on Earth, also known as the "cryosphere" contains the frozen parts of the planet. It includes snow and ice on land, ice caps, glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. </p>

Groundwater fills all vacant areas underneath, known as the saturated zone, until it reaches a solid barrier of rock. Aquifers are bodies of rock and sediment that retain groundwater and allow it to flow. Groundwater's residence duration in aquifers varies greatly, ranging from a few days or weeks to ten thousand years or more.</p>

                                    <p>Evaporation is the transformation of a liquid's surface into a gas. Liquid water (in the ocean, lakes, or rivers) evaporates to form water vapor. The sun drives the process of evaporation in the water cycle. The rays of the sun interacts with liquid water on the ocean's surface, transforming it into an invisible gas (water vapor). Evaporation is also affected by wind, temperature, and the density of the body of water.</p>

                                    <p>Condensation is the process by which a gas becomes a liquid. In the water cycle, water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and turns into liquid. Condensation, like evaporation, is controlled by sunlight. Water vapor cools until it hits its saturation limit, also known as the dew point. Air pressure has a significant impact on an area's dew point.</p>

Light has a considerable impact on stomatal opening, hence it is frequently related with the sun and the evaporative process.</p>

If water falls on plants, it may evaporate off the leaves and return to the atmosphere or drip down to the ground. Some of this water may then be absorbed by plant roots in the ground.</p>
                                    <p>In frigid climates, precipitation can accumulate on land as snow, ice, or glaciers. If temperatures rise, the ice melts into liquid water, which soaks into the earth or flows into rivers or the ocean.</p>
                                    <p>Water that comes into contact with land may flow over it and end up in seas, rivers, or lakes. This water is referred to as "surface run-off". Some of the precipitation will soak (or "infiltrate") into the soil, where it will slowly flow through the earth until it ultimately reaches a river or the ocean.</p>
